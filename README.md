# FlaskTemplate
A tiny Flask and Docker Template  

## Description
This is just a Flask & Docker Template for anyone to use as a jumping off point for projects.  

### Features  
- A simple, clean, and modern-ish Flask site with most of what you need to get started
- A prebuilt Dockerfile and docker-compose file that should be enough to get you started
- Some helpful comments and such throughout the template to explain things

### Built with  
- Flask
- Docker
- Bootstrap
- Caffeine

## Getting started  

- Clone this repo
- Edit the files to your heart's content
- Host it, share it, etc

## Future plans
- [ ] Update template to use Bootstrap5 (or whatever the newest is at the time that I get to this)
